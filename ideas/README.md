# Ideas

## Teams data structures

An example is [teams.json](teams.json) file.

## Possible routes

- `/` => Home: explain what | who | why of the project
- `/teams` => Teams: your teams as ui cards
- `/team/:id` => TeamDetail: stats / player list / settings (edit team name, color, ...)
- `/players` => Players: all available players (big table with players also from other teams)
- `/player/:id` => PlayerDetails: stats / settings (edit name, number, position, profile pic)
- `/*` => NotFound
